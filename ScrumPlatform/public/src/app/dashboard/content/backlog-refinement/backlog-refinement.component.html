                <h3>Now for a Quick Exercise</h3>
                <p>Paint a Room!<p>
                <p>For this exercise we will have the dev team go through and scrum the process of painting a room. Unlike in the typical scrum process we will have the dev team generate the product backlog. Take 5-10 minutes and individually write down the steps for painting a room in a house. Afterwards the group will come together and compare tasks and, as a group, decide which of the steps are needed to paint and place them in the product backlog. </p>
                <p>For our example we will start with the list below in the product backlog.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Measure the room</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Decide on a color</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Get supplies</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Prep the room for painting</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Paint the room</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Clean up</p>
