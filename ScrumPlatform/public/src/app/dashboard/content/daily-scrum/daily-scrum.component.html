                <h3>What is a Daily Scrum?</h3>
                <p>During a sprint, the development team conducts daily scrum or “standup” meetings.</p>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong></p>
                <p>Impediments are indentified for later action, outside of this particular session. Alignment of activities across the Development Team. Offline meetings can be identified during discussion but held later</p>
                <p><strong>Roster:</strong></p>
                <p>Development Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner (optional)</p>
                <p><strong>Time-box:</strong></p>
                <p>This 15-minute time-box is enforced to make sure that this is a quick check-in amongst the dev team members, and does not turn into a design session. The goal is to create a plan for the next 24 hours, taking into account everything that's happened so far in the sprint, and reevaluate the plan as we get closer to meeting the sprint goal</p>
                <p><strong>Frequency:</strong></p>
                <p>These meetings occur at the same time and place each day and last for a maximum of 15 minutes.</p>
                <p>Here is the thing many people misunderstand about the daily scrum: it is by and for the development team. </p>
                <p><strong>Benefits of Daily Scrum:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                        <p>Sprint goal helps guide dev team in terms of what is the purpose of doing this sprint</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Sets dev team up to identify new work that endangers sprint goal, issues/roadblocks slowing down progress preventing from moving forward & meeting sprint goal, the team will have that discussion and adapt the plan</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>by switching focus from traditional status meeting being about what tasks are being done, we are focusing on our progress toward a goal and a valuable outcome for our business</p>

                    <li>

                <h3>Questions to Ask to Make the Most of the Daily Scrum</h3>
                <p><strong>What’s going on that other team members might not be aware of?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>This brings any issues to the surface and increases the knowledge of other dev team members.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Is there any of this work that we think we aren’t going to complete?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Asking this question up front can help more quickly identify obstacles that can get in the way of completing the work.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Other team members can help consider alternate ways to complete work</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Other team members can help identify a smaller slice of the work that can still deliver value at the next release</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Take this to product owner and suggest “we don't think we are going to get this work done. Of the remaining work, where would you like us to focus our efforts?"</p>
                    </li>
