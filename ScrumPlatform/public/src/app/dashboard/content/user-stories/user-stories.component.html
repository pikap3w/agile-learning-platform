                <p>﻿User stories are derived from the Product Backlog which contains a list of all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that constitute changes to be made to the product in the future.</p>
                <p>Product Backlog Items (PBI) have the following attributes: description, order, estimate, and value.</p>

                <h3>What are User Stories in The Scrum approach to agile development?</h3>
                <p>﻿User stories are intended to help teams and Product Owners focus on the customer by personifying the application and its features. This is done by creating WHO the end-user is (type of user), WHAT they want to do (goal or desire), and WHY they want to do it (outcome and value); and teams tell this story from the perspective of the end-user.</p>
                <p>A statement from a "user"</p>
                <p>Written in business language</p>
                <p>NOT a signed contract</p>

                <p><strong>Working Title -</strong> make sure that the stoy has a titl that was derived from the description. These need to match, if they don't they'll cause some confusion!</p>
                <p><strong>Description -</strong> it should be clear from this section what VALUE is being provided as wel as who or what wold BENEFIT from this particular story being completed.</p>
                <p><strong>Acceptance Criteria -</strong> this criteria helps the Scrum Team come to agreement on th "Definition of Done" for this item.</p>

                <h3>Why do teams use User Stories?</h3>
                <p>They make the development process more efficient by framing the tasks with the end-user in mind. This will reduce time spent on unecessary features that do not benefit the end-user. </p>

								<p>Compare items relative to each other instead of a vacuum</p>

								<p>Do not map points to hours!</p>

								<p>A team's defination of an item they think is a "3" may change. If so, all other estimates would need to change as well!</p>
